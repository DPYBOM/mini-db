# mini-db

A simple database project written in C for learning purposes.

## About

This project is intended to help me learn about basic data manipulation in a database-like environment using the C programming language. It focuses on understanding file handling, memory management, and command-line interaction.

## Planned Features

- Read from a database file and load all entries into memory (cascading entries into a list).
- Validate the security and integrity of the database file.
- Perform different actions based on command-line flags.
